# Welcome to the Hotel Reservation Program Package!
This package contains all necessary code and supporting documents for the UMGC CMSC 495 Capstone in Computer Science Group project. 

# About this Program
The Hotel Reservation program is a software application written in Java designed to facilitate the process of booking and managing hotel accommodations. Such a program helps hotels and their guests streamline the reservation process, manage room availability, and improve overall customer service. Developed over a period of seven weeks, the project was implemented by a group of three developers. 

The finished product provides hotel reservation services to customers with a dynamic set of tools to manage reservations and search for available hotel rooms with ease. By creating and logging into a unique user account, customers may input their search information for a hotel room containing the location of the hotel and dates.
